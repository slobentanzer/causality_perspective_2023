    "abstract": "<jats:p>Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. Cited in more than 2,100 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interest to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Dr Judea Pearl has received the 2011 Rumelhart Prize for his leading research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and systems from The Cognitive Science Society.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks in an encoder-decoder configuration. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including ensembles by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with large and limited training data.",

    "abstract": "The key idea behind the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is that real-world data is generated by a few explanatory factors of variation which can be recovered by unsupervised learning algorithms. In this paper, we provide a sober look at recent progress in the field and challenge some common assumptions. We first theoretically show that the unsupervised learning of disentangled representations is fundamentally impossible without inductive biases on both the models and the data. Then, we train more than 12000 models covering most prominent methods and evaluation metrics in a reproducible large-scale experimental study on seven different data sets. We observe that while the different methods successfully enforce properties ``encouraged'' by the corresponding losses, well-disentangled models seemingly cannot be identified without supervision. Furthermore, increased disentanglement does not seem to lead to a decreased sample complexity of learning for downstream tasks. Our results suggest that future work on disentanglement learning should be explicit about the role of inductive biases and (implicit) supervision, investigate concrete benefits of enforcing disentanglement of the learned representations, and consider a reproducible experimental setup covering several data sets.",

    "abstract": "Spurred by tremendous success in pattern matching and prediction tasks, researchers increasingly resort to machine learning to aid original scientific discovery. Given large amounts of observational data about a system, can we uncover the rules that govern its evolution? Solving this task holds the great promise of fully understanding the causal interactions and being able to make reliable predictions about the system's behavior under interventions. We take a step towards answering this question for time-series data generated from systems of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). While the governing ODEs might not be identifiable from data alone, we show that combining simple regularization schemes with flexible neural ODEs can robustly recover the dynamics and causal structures from time-series data. Our results on a variety of (non)-linear first and second order systems as well as real data validate our method. We conclude by showing that we can also make accurate predictions under interventions on variables or the system itself.",

    "abstract": "\"In Myth and Measurement, David Card and Alan Krueger presented a powerful challenge to the conventional view that higher minimum wages necessarily reduce jobs for low-wage workers. In a work that has profoundly influenced public policy as well as the direction of economic research, the authors put standard economic theory to the test, using empirical methods and conducting a critical reexamination of existing literature on the minimum wage. Documenting the effects of the minimum wage on family earnings, poverty outcomes, and the stock market valuation of low-wage employers, they presented a wealth of evidence showing that increases in the minimum wage lead to increases in pay, but no loss in jobs. With a new preface discussing new data, Myth and Measurement continues to shift the terms of the debate on the minimum wage\"--Back cover",

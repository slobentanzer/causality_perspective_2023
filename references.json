    "abstract": "<jats:p>Written by one of the preeminent researchers in the field, this book provides a comprehensive exposition of modern analysis of causation. It shows how causality has grown from a nebulous concept into a mathematical theory with significant applications in the fields of statistics, artificial intelligence, economics, philosophy, cognitive science, and the health and social sciences. Judea Pearl presents and unifies the probabilistic, manipulative, counterfactual, and structural approaches to causation and devises simple mathematical tools for studying the relationships between causal connections and statistical associations. Cited in more than 2,100 scientific publications, it continues to liberate scientists from the traditional molds of statistical thinking. In this revised edition, Judea Pearl elucidates thorny issues, answers readers' questions, and offers a panoramic view of recent advances in this field of research. Causality will be of interest to students and professionals in a wide variety of fields. Dr Judea Pearl has received the 2011 Rumelhart Prize for his leading research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and systems from The Cognitive Science Society.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "\"In Myth and Measurement, David Card and Alan Krueger presented a powerful challenge to the conventional view that higher minimum wages necessarily reduce jobs for low-wage workers. In a work that has profoundly influenced public policy as well as the direction of economic research, the authors put standard economic theory to the test, using empirical methods and conducting a critical reexamination of existing literature on the minimum wage. Documenting the effects of the minimum wage on family earnings, poverty outcomes, and the stock market valuation of low-wage employers, they presented a wealth of evidence showing that increases in the minimum wage lead to increases in pay, but no loss in jobs. With a new preface discussing new data, Myth and Measurement continues to shift the terms of the debate on the minimum wage\"--Back cover",
